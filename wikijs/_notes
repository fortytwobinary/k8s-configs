Today, wikijs did not work. After several hours I finally determined that while the pod 
could connect to the MariaDB database, I could NOT connect to the database server using
SSH. This is indicative of past problems that I have had with KM8-Ps (specific server hardware). For an unknown
reason, I have to power-off the SBC and plug it back in to reboot. I have to risk an 
unclean shutdown every time this occurs.

It did show that I need:

1. database backups
2. periodic (timely) ssh service checks
3. mariadb connection periodic checks
4. shows the need for immediate problem understanding
5. shows the need for quick restoration
